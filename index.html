                <p>Japanese food has become trendy in the US. The number of Japanese restaurants in the US has been
                    growing consistently each year, and with them come swarms of unauthentic representations of Japanese
                    cuisine. The modern Japanese cuisine, in its authentic form is informed by two things: a rich
                    national heritage and a long history of cultural exchanges with the outside world. Our
                    visualizations hope to demonstrate using data science why this statement is true, and why it is the
                    key to achieving an authentic Japanese flavor.</p>
                <p>Our main dataset is a web-scraped corpus of authentic Japanese recipes from <b><em><a
                                href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/about/">Just One Cookbook</a></em></b>, a food
                    blog
                    created by
                    Chef Namiko Hirasawa Chen (Nami) in 2011 with a focus on authentic and modern Japanese recipes.
                    Supplementary datasets are added on-demand whenever additional information is needed for a
                    particular data visualization. Through this dataset, we hope reveal what makes a Japanese dish
                    authentic and present non-static visualizations that a user may interact with for their own personal
                    inquiry.</p>

                <h1>What are the most essential Japanese ingredients, and how much do people know about them in the
                    US?
                </h1>
                <p>Authentic flavors are impossible to achieve without authentic ingredients. Our first visualization is
                    a compound barplot and boxplot that shows the most frequently used ingredients in Japanese recipes
                    as well as how popular these ingredients are in US-based Google searches. What is clearly revealed
                    is that many of the top-40 most used ingredients in Japanese dishes are Japanese exclusive
                    ingredients and among them, these ingredients have very little public awareness: mirin, dashi,
                    daikon radish, shiso leaves, katsuobushi, shichimi togarashi, and Tokyo negi. So if you happen to be
                    a Japanese food connoisseur and you believe that the Japanese dish you are having at a US restaurant
                    is not authentic, it is very likely that the dish neglected having one of these essential Japanese
                    ingredients.</p>

                <h1>How are ingredients combined for each type of Japanese dishes (e.g. appetizer, entree, etc.)?
                </h1>
                <p>This plot reveals how frequently each category of ingredients is used for each recipe category. Some
                    insights from this plot include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Japanese appetizers are usually made directly from processed ingredients to minimize cooking 
                        time and effort.</li>
                    <li>Japanese soups and stews use mushrooms and fungus more frequently than proteins to produce the
                        base stock. This is pretty unique because for example, American cuisine most frequently use
                        protein such as chicken or beef to produce stock.</li>
                    <li>Unlikely American desserts which feature frequent use of processed foods, Japanese desserts use
                        very little processed ingredients. The base for tart and sweetness come from fruits and
                        condiments.</li>

                <h1>Where do these sources of
                    inspiration come from?</h1>
                <p>Japan's culinary culture is informed by both its rich national heritage and a long history of
                    cultural exchanges with the outside world. Many only know about the former and indeed, obedience to
                    heritage and tradition is exemplified in visualizations above. Nevertheless, the cultural openness
                    of the Japanese culinary tradition can be clearly seen in this choropleth. Our analysis reveals that
                    <b>almost one out of seven</b> of the collected modern Japanese recipes find its origin in a foreign
                    country. The top 3 most influential foreign origins are the United States, China, and France.
                </p>
                <p>At the same time, this map is an underestimation for the true number of Japanese dishes with foreign
                    origins. Chef Nami, the author of our dataset made the choice of denoting the foreign origins of a
                    Japanese dish only if the dish is imported to Japan after World War II, and our visualization is in
                    accordance with Chef Nami's choice. If a longer period of history is put into consideration, one
                    would find that many dishes without notes of foreign origin still find their origins abroad. An
                    example of this is <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempura#Origins">tempura</a></em>.
                    This battered and deep-fried vegetarian dish was
                    introduced to Japan by Portuguese Catholic missionaries in the 16th century, despite the disguise of
                    a Japanese name and being widely assumed as a native Japanese. We have to give credit to the
                    Japanese people for their extraordinary history of learning from and internalizing the merits of
                    foreign cultures. The cultural agility to learn from others isn't just seen in Japan's culinary
                    traditions, but also in its cultural and political history (see <em><a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji">Chinese characters in
                            Japanese writing</a></em>, the <em><a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_Restoration">Meiji Restoration</a></em> which
                    westernized
                    Japan's legal system).</p>

                <p>As creators of these visualizations, we hope that they help users discover something about Japanese
                    cuisine that they never knew before. No matter the end user is a food critic or just a curious
                    reader, we hope that the interactive features also lead you to inquiries and use cases that are
                    beyond our original design intentions. Lastly, we hope that these data visualizations open for you
                    an avenue to further inquiry of and appreciation for the richness and complexity in Japan's culinary
                    traditions. Enjoy!

# Dataset requirements 

* The project topic is up to you and you can use any publicly available dataset(s); however you may not use any of the following:
    * New York City Taxicab
    * Airline Delays
    * Amazon Reviews
    * Iris dataset
    * Penguins dataset
    * Any datasets used in labs, lectures, or homework assignments
    * COVID related

* You are allowed to use [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com) datasets. However, keep in mind that Kaggle datasets are primarily designed for modeling. While you can build visualizations from these dataset, there may not be enough data points and/or variables 
    
* You should strive to use multiple datasets then you can join or layer them in a way that makes sense. Pick something that interests you.

* Groups may use the same dataset(s) with the condition that each group creates unique analysis and visualizations. 

* Ideally, your dataset(s) should include:
    * Both qualitative and quantitative data
    * A time element
    * A geospatial element
    * A text element
    * The ability to be transformed into a graph/network

* There are many sources of available datasets. Please search beyond the obvious places. Here are some suggestions:

# Dataset proposal submission

Please create short document and save it as PDF that addresses the following. **Make sure that the URLs for your data sources are correct and functional.**

* Team members: Full Names and NetIDs

* Datasets to be used, **with source URLs** so we can take a look, and a brief description of the datasets

* Why do you want to use this data? What do you wish to explore? We don't expect this to be a final answer, but at least show directional thinking. 

We will reject dataset proposals that:

* Do not have URLs to the source (or of the source is incorrect)

* Do not provide a thoughtful answer to the question

* Are trivial datasets and not rich enough to allow you to do a comprehensive project
